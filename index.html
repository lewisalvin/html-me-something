                  <h2>Hey!</h2>
                  <p>My name is Alvin Lewis and I come from a small family of one sibling, a mom and a dad.  I have a small family of my own with myself, my wife and our daughter.  
                      <br>
                      My current mission is to find my own path (with no outside influences) and walk that path as far as I can take it.
                  </p>

                    <p>I have a very beautiful familiy.  My wife and I have a two year old daughter who is taking full advantage of her "Terrible Two" stage.  Even while in this "Terrible Two" stage she is still an angel.  She enjoys decorating the floor with all of her toys and books, watching cartoons, reading, painting and face-timing anyone who will answer.

                  <h2>Art</h2>
                  <p>I'm an artist.  I love art a LOT.  I love making it, I love looking at it.  This is something that I truly enjoy doing, if I never made another dollar off of my art I would still continue to make it.  I mainly paint in acrylic, oil and watercolor paints.</p>

                  <h2>Escapism</h2>
                  <p>Like many people, I have a lot of obligations and responsibilities.  We all need a daily mental break from reality and we all use different things to give us these breaks.  Like I mentioned before, I love art (all forms of it).  I enjoy music, movies, tv, and stand up comedy.  Below are a few shows that have my attention at the moment. <br> "Good Girls"  "Insecure"  "Billions"  "Power"  "Curb Your Enthusiasm"</p>
